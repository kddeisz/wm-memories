		<p>The goal of this project: collect stories from the William and Mary community, and see how others have made meaning on our beloved campus.</p>
		
		<p>While reviewing a sketch of the William and Mary campus, five alumni began pointing out to each other some of the locations that were important to them. They quickly realized that the sketch represented their intertwined William and Mary experience all in one image despite having different memories at the same locations. As the oldest university in the United States, the College has multi-generational layers of memory. It's a place of history, our history, as a community - as a tribe. While our memories vary over time, they are shared within one space. Even as the physical campus continues to evolve, generations of tribe members both new and old continue to create meaning.</p>
