# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      para1: 'While reviewing a sketched map of the William and Mary campus, five alumni began pointing out to each other some of the locations that were important to them during their time at the College. They quickly realized that despite having different experiences throughout their 4 years, their individual memories were all captured within a single map.'
      para2: "As the oldest university in the United States, W&M has provided memories to generations of students and alumni. It's a place of history - our history, as a community and as a Tribe. Despite new construction and other changes over the years, the campus has remained the one constant throughout every student's college experience. We seek to celebrate that by welcoming all students, past and present, to share their own memories on this website."
